# so_long

This is a small 2D game built in C for a 42 Lisboa project.

As mandatory, I used the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

You can run it with:
<pre> cd so_long && make test</pre>
